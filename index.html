            <img class="img gluttonyimg" src="./Images/gluttony.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="p-gluttony">
                Gluttony means over-indulgence and over-consumption of food, drink, or wealth items,
                particularly as
                status symbols. In
                Christianity, it is considered a sin if the excessive desire for food causes it to be
                withheld
                from
                the needy. Some
                Christian denominations consider gluttony one of the seven deadly sins.
                We're also pretty inactive.

                shouting, use of obscenities and cruel words, beating, pushing, murder. Malice, hate,

                revenge, slander, the
                passing of judgment on others, giving offense to others. A classic case of wrath is long-running family

                will. Reading
                heretical, profane and vain books. Revolt against authority. Since it’s an irrational feeling of
                self-worth, proud people never see.

                define
                and credit as sin,
                since it refers to an assortment of ideas, dating from antiquity and including mental,
                spiritual,
                pathological, and
                physical states.Sloth means wasting your valuable time like laziness and not utilizing the

                called Avarice or
                Covetousness.You'll be boiled alive in oil. Bear in mind that it's the finest, most
                luxurious
                boiling oil that money can buy, but
                it's still boiling.Greed is linked with the frog and the color yellow.

                Envy is the desire for others' traits, status, abilities, or situation. Because people
                are

                Envy is
                linked with the dog and the color green.
                It arises from vainglory, and severs a man from his neighbor.
                It’s also because of envy that Cain murdered his brother, Abel.
